1. What is the DOM?

The DOM is the Document Object Model, which is a tree whose nodes represent the elements of an HTML page.

2. What is an event?

An event is something that happens to the DOM, usually initiated by a user (for example, moving the mouse or clicking on something on the screen).

3. What is an event listener?

An event listener can be attached to a DOM node. That node now listens for that event to fire and, when it does, calls the corresponding function that was registered when the event listener was declared.

4. What is a Constructor

A constructor is syntactic sugar for prototypal inheritance in JavaScript that mimics class syntax in other OOP languages like Java.
